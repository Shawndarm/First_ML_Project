# First_ML_Project

In the context of our data analysis and Machine Learning project, we tackled four distinct exercises, utilizing varied techniques to explore and interpret complex datasets. 

The Exercise 1 involved to choose the best algorithm to model a binary dependent variable from two predictors, revealing satisfactory accuracy for one of the classes. 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Exercise 2 allowed for the decomposition of the variance of diverse vehicle characteristics, leading to meaningful interpretations of the main variation factors. The k-means and hierarchical clustering methods of Exercise 3 offered insights into the segmentation of vehicles, while Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) in Exercise 4 provided a glimpse into the associations between dog breeds and their functions. This report synthesizes the results of each approach, illustrated with graphs, and concludes on their relevance and potential for application.
